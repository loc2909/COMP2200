In this dataset, each user has the ability to post a rating and review for the products they purchased. Additionally, other users can evaluate the initial rating and review by expressing their trust or distrust.\n\nThis dataset includes a wealth of information for each user. Details such as their profile, ID, gender, city of birth, product ratings (on a scale of 1-5), reviews, and the prices of the products they purchased are all included. Moreover, for each product rating, we have information about the product name, ID, price, and category, the rating score, the timestamp of the rating and review, and the average helpfulness of the rating given by others (on a scale of 1-5).\n\nThe dataset is from several data sources, and we have merged all the data into a single CSV file named 'A Combined E-commerce Dataset.csv'. The structure of this dataset is represented in the header shown below.\n\n| userId | gender | rating | review| item | category | helpfulness | timestamp | item_id | item_price | user_city|\n\n    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |  ---- |  ---- |  \n    \n#### Description of Fields\n\n* __userId__ - the user's id\n* __gender__ - the user's gender\n* __rating__ - the user's rating towards the item\n* __review__ - the user's review towards the item\n* __item__ - the item's name\n* __category__ - the category of the item\n* __helpfulness__ - the average helpfulness of this rating\n* __timestamp__ - the timestamp when the rating is created\n* __item_id__ - the item's id\n* __item_price__ - the item's price\n* __user_city__ - the city of user's birth\n\nNote that, a user may rate multiple items and an item may receive ratings and reviews from multiple users. The \"helpfulness\" is an average value based on all the helpfulness values given by others.\n\nThere are four questions to explore with the data as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"data-relation.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"400\"/>\n(You can find the data relation diagram on iLearn - Portfolio Part 1 resources - Fig1)\n",
